## Assessment 1:

The MSe (Mean Squared Error) for the linear regression model was 14.25 while the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for the linear regression model was 2.57. In comparison, my tuned nural network with a longer train time, additional hidden layers and a greater number of neurons had a MSE of 10.69 and an MAE of 2.18.

The train and test results of the tuned Neural Network after adding 5 hidden layers with 128 neurons each became slightly closer. The trained results became closer to the test results, however they were not exact and the change isnt immediately noticable when looking at the values plotted on a graph.
